HTML semantics
	-HTML5 introduced new containers that could replace <div>
	-Aimed at helping css or other languages that read a page see what you have
	-Remember that HTML and CSS are cascading
		-They use the bottom most file or command when rendering the page
	-Need to ensure cross browser compatability
	-Reset.css
		-Deletes all defaults when webpage loaded into different browsers
		-Normalize.css will work as well
