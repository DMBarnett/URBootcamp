CSS
	-Margin, Border, Padding is the order an element is surrounded in
	
Floating
	-float determines how elements flow around eachother
	-Can set elements in line, on top of, beside , etc
	-Block vs Inline
		-block will always fill the entire width of the page
		-next block will appear below, not beside the first
		-Inline wraps beside eachother
		-Inline fills all space
	-Once an element is floated, it will auto fill next to it
	-Sometimes we have to clear the float to avoid awkward styling
	-Really need to study up and learn Float, overflow, clear, etc.
